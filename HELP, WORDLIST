I had a very bad day installing WPSCAN and after that I fighted with unlimited gem install problems. Finally I got through, and I wanted to find out the password for an username, but Guess what, the command of brute force wasn't working at all.

each time it says "Error, no such file or directory"

I have several word lists in computer (but in windows system). The darkc0de.lst or rockyou.txt simply are nowhere to find.
